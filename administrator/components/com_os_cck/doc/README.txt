02. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

OrdaSoft CCK Pro is a Joomla component. It needs a functioning Joomla 3.x 
installation. OrdaSoft CCK Pro needs PHP 5 with  CURL, XSL and GD  
extensions to work properly.

PLEASE CHECK BEFORE INSTALLING OrdaSoft CCK:
In order for csv export to work, you need to compile PHP5 with support for the 
XSL extension!
In order for CAPTCHA images (Guest User anti-spam for reviews) 
to work, you need to compile PHP5 with the GD extension!

CHECK YOUR PHP INSTALLATION FOR PROPER EXTENSIONS:
First please make sure PHP5 has the above extensions enabled!
- If you run your own web server, please recompile PHP with support for XSL, 
  CURL, GD.
- If your website is with a hosting provider, check with them for the inclusion 
  of these PHP extensions.
OrdaSoft CCK needs these PHP extensions to install and function correctly!

INSTALLER CHECK FOR PHP EXTENSIONS:
The OrdaSoft CCK installer will check for the availability of these PHP 
extensions and issue a warning if they are missing. If you get such a warning, 
just uninstall OrdaSoft CCK, fix the PHP extensions first, and then 
reinstall OrdaSoft CCK.

PLEASE NOTE:
Even though we can do checks for the proper PHP extensions inside the 
OrdaSoft CCK installer package, we have no way to roll back the installation 
once started, not even when a check fails. So installation will continue, even 
if a PHP extension is not present. This is unfortunately a limitation of the 
Joomla installer!



03. LICENSE
-----------

OrdaSoft CCK Pro is released as a commercial component.
Check the included LICENSE.txt file for license details.
There is also a Basic version available (with less functionality), released 
under the GNU/GPL.



04. INSTALLATION
----------------

OrdaSoft CCK can be installed easily with the standard Joomla component 
installer. For additional information on how to set up and configure

http://ordasoft.com/articles/News/OS-CCK-Documentation/



07. SUPPORT

The OrdaSoft site has a [Support Forums] section for support to the 
OrdaSoft CCK component, modules and plugins. There is a special forum section 
dedicated to registered OrdaSoft CCK Pro users.



08. ADDONS (MODULES, PLUGINS)
-----------------------------

Modules and plugins are constantly being developed for use with 
OrdaSoft CCK. You can download them from the download sections on the website
http://ordasoft.com/cck-content-construction-kit-for-joomla.html



09. LANGUAGES
-------------

OrdaSoft CCK Pro comes with English (default) and Russian language (translator: Anna Yeremenko) files included.
The OrdaSoft CCK interface will automatically pick up the frontend or backend 
language set in your Joomla configuration. Frontend language switches with 
JoomFish will also result in the automatic language change in OrdaSoft CCK.

You can add non-included languages to OrdaSoft CCK by creating your own 
translations. 
Copy en-GB.com_os_cck.ini and en-GB.com_os_cck.sys.ini from the directory /components/com_os_cck/language/, 
rename it to your language and then create the translation. Next add the 
language selectors to the code and upload the translation to your OrdaSoft CCK.
You can find full instructions on creating translations and adding languages 
on the website.
